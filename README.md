# pdfeditor
PDF editor is a Python project that is used to edit PDF files through various ways, by using graphics (pygame) and various other python libraries to access the PDFs

## Features

By using PDF editor you will be able to:
- convert an image to PDF
- split a PDF file to its pages
- merge 2 or more PDF files to one new file
- detect words inside a PDF file
- extract tables from PDF files (beta)

## Setup

Import the following libraries (you will need to pip install them first):
```
pip install PyPDF2

pip install Pillow

Download all the files listed in the repository ( !OUTPUT FOLDER DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DOWNLOADED ), and then just run the main.py file to get started!

## Showcase

The following window will open while running main.py:

![monitor](https://github.com/etecnos/pdfeditor/blob/main/output/monitor.png?raw=true)


Each image corresponds to a certain function executed by the program.
